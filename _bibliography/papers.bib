ABSTRACT = {Vibrio spp. have an important role in biogeochemical cycles; some species are disease agents for aquatic animals and/or humans. Predicting population dynamics of Vibrio spp. in natural environments is crucial to predicting how the future conditions will affect the dynamics of these bacteria. The majority of existing Vibrio spp. population growth models were developed in controlled environments, and their applicability to natural environments is unknown. We collected all available functional models from the literature, and distilled them into 28 variants using unified nomenclature. Next, we assessed their ability to predict Vibrio spp. abundance using two new and five already published longitudinal datasets on Vibrio abundance in four different habitat types. Results demonstrate that, while the models were able to predict Vibrio spp. abundance to an extent, the predictions were not reliable. Models often underperformed, especially in environments under significant anthropogenic influence such as aquaculture and urban coastal habitats. We discuss implications and limitations of our analysis, and suggest research priorities; in particular, we advocate for measuring and modeling organic matter.},

	Abstract = {The need for reliable taxonomic species identification is always present. Correct identification of specimens is based on taxonomic research, scattered in the scientific literature and accessible only for a restricted group of specialists or research institutions with extensive library facilities (Zuquim et al. 2017). Therefore, identification keys that summarize the knowledge of a group of biota are very important; they provide the link between producers and users of taxonomy. Recently, printed identification keys are increasingly being replaced or supplemented by computer-aided keys.},

abstract = {Low-cost sensors available on the market allow reliable and straightforward research of model organism responses to changes in environmental conditions caused by xenobiotics or natural ecological processes. The purpose of this work was to develop a low-cost Arduino-based respiratory activity measuring system employing CO2 sensors (ResTox) applicable for various research and risk assessment purposes, providing a stable platform and support for further development and extension of current capabilities. The presented system comprises hardware and accompanying software solutions. The instrument employs multiple digital CO2 measuring sensors based on non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) technology, a waterproof temperature sensor, and a phototransistor light sensor. The cross-platform ResTox software support enables simple control of the measuring device and sensor output data storage during the experiments. Due to its uncomplicated and compact design, the developed system represents a versatile solution for experiments in both field and laboratory conditions and with animal and plant organisms.}

abstract = {Earthworm behavior represents a valuable endpoint in ecological and ecotoxicological studies, providing insight into individual- and population-level responses of organisms to ecological factors and xenobiotics. Difficulties in observing activities of soil-dwelling organisms come from the soil matrix surrounding the animals. We present an automated system for continuous monitoring of earthworm behavior directly in the soil. Performances of the developed system are tested in an avoidance test set-up. The developed system includes a 2D terrarium serving as an experimental compartment and a deep convolutional neural network model for continuous monitoring of earthworm behavior. Quantification of activity of organisms is based on the predictions of the neural network model made from image sequences captured during the exposure. Performance of the system was validated by comparison with results of the standard avoidance test, using H3BO3, a standard pollutant. The presented system represents a simple, cost-effective, fast, accurate and objective tool for continuous earthworm behavior monitoring in ecological and ecotoxicological studies. Source code and training data of this system are made freely available on GitHub.},
